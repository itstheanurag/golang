## Folder Structure and Contents

| Folder      | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| closures/   | Demonstrates closuresâ€”functions that capture variables from their surrounding scope.          |
| input/      | Shows how to read and process user input from the terminal, including string-to-number conversion. |
| loops/      | A comprehensive guide to all types of loops in Go, including for-loops, range, break, continue, and more. |
| pointers/   | Explains pointers, memory addresses, dereferencing, and how Go handles passing by value vs reference. |
| primes/     | Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers.             |
| slices/     | Covers slices, their differences from arrays, and why slices are the preferred collection type in Go. |
| struct/     | Demonstrates structs and interfaces, including polymorphism, type assertions, and real-world modeling. |
| variables/  | Explains Go's variable types, declaration styles, constants, and their use cases.             |
| channels/   | A deep dive into Go channels and concurrency patterns: unbuffered/buffered channels, select, worker pools, pipelines, fan-in/fan-out, quit/done channels, multiplexing, and more. |
